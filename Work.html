            <h3>Wipro Technologies (July 2022 - Present)</h3>
            <p> I began my journey with Wipro in July 2022, starting as a Java trainee. During my initial months, I dedicated my efforts to honing my skills in Java programming, investing a significant amount of time to enhance my proficiency. After spending four months focusing on personal skill development in Java, I transitioned into a more project-oriented role. <br><br>
                In December 2022, I was assigned to the NBA Project, where my team and I are actively engaged in working with Azure DevOps Server and Azure Portal technologies. This project has provided me with valuable hands-on experience in utilizing these platforms to deliver effective solutions and contribute to the project's success. Overall, my time at Wipro has allowed 
                me to evolve from a Java trainee to a proactive member of the NBA Project, engaging with technologies crucial for modern software development and project management.</p>
